"# Technical_Test_Warwick" 

I used jupyter notebook to develop the code, in this way i think the code is easier to visualize. 
If you have any question can you send me an email to nunzio.gatti@hotmail.com

N.b.
For accomplishing some tasks I have use the pre-trained model './wiki-news-300d-1M.vec' that I could not load on git because 
was too big. Then some parts of the code are not executable.
