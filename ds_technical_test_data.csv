This would be a nice mouse if it didn't have numerous bright leds that constantly flash and generally annoy me for no reason.
this item it put together well but the ball only lasts for about 3 to 6 months before it stops functioning properly.
I bought two of these cards for two different computers and both were damaged. The quality of these cards is not good.
This cable 1.6$ and price tell you what you buying! Trust me I use this cable 1 day and its brook!
it did not work on my 2012 tundra and Clarion NX702 i tried all setting reprogramming  with no luck .
never had the experience to fully enjoy the machine.I seen alot of great reviews but  I didn't get the chance to experience
Item does not work!My older lcd tv has only one hdmi input.I tried the auto switch no video or audio.
I bought this to use with my 2011 iMac.  It would not keep connected to the bluetooth.  I returned it with no problems.
Every one i tried were coasters. Will not buy again.  I do not recommend these.  Do not buy them.  I bought the RIDATA
They can't be bothered to include decent wall anchors so just imagine what junk the rest of the mount is.
You get what you pay for with this being extremely fragile.  I broke this one within a week of receiving.
item doesn't work at all. it was dead on arrival. i suggest you not waste your time and money with this seller.
I bought this adapter to attach to an FM modulator for my ipod.  No sound came out of the left speakers in my car.
"Is not working im seating only 4 feet from my laptop or tv and not working, i tried many ways and nothing."
If you can't charge through the keyboard you must then detach and charge the tablet.  That's a killer for me.
"The rubber part is very flimsy and degrades quite fast. you are better off having your Bold 9900 naked, don't buy."
Quality is sub par at best.  Cables do not fit well and post clamp comes loose with little effort.  Look elsewhere.
Couldn't get the Arduino IDE to recognize the device. Picked up the Pololu ISP instead; works great with my custom PCBs.
Device will not hold its battery properly so the device won't charge. Also very uncomfortable to hold in the hand.
Was not able to use this as intended. It just doesn't share USB connections. Save your money. Do not recommend.
"i hate it, i hate it, i Hate it never buying from this guys again. no way no way. ok"
"a cheap way of trying to take macro photos. I tried it, not impressed so I threw it away."
the item was broken so I tossed in the trash. did not pay much for it. should of not been broken
The title says it all. Did not work with my ipad mini. Ended up getting the expensive Apple one but it works!
"batteries are right, but charger is wrong. It is not for those batteries. I am going to throw its away."
"the product has fallen not acceptable, my old router is but consistent that this, sadly I am not satisfied with the product"
I buy this product because I think it work on my phone. But not work so I think it not make for my phone.
Bought 10 of these.  Had to work very hard to get the buttons working.  Finally got it working but not sure for how long.
"It's not that it didn't work... It was my mistake that this was a used unit, so I returned it."
"Not sure what new technology these speed trap guys are using, but the radar does not pick it up at all."
"Good price, served its purpose easily damage delivered in a timely fashion does an ok job as protection doesn't make iPad feel bulky"
Nice design but it didn't work as described. I read quite a few reviews before purchase but took my chances.
My display kept going dark after bootup.  never resolved the problem.  Have not tried the adapter in other applications yet.
"I sent it back because I ended up getting a strong access point to replace it. Still, it did what I needed."
I like the idea but this is cheap material and poorly made. It is also difficult to keep clean. Would not recommend.
"I used this item for my XBOX360 but did not notice a change in clarity or any way,shape or form."
Flimsy and uncomfortable to use when reading looking for a leather case instead. For the price it's better than no protection at all
"poor quality crimps, worked, but had to recrimp item thin wire and plug fit too tight. finally got it seated"
Had to return this product..it cause my network and connections to lag..didn't work well for me. Wouldn't recommend . Needs work
it only works with some beats. its okay to just doesn't really fit my product of beats which made me sad.
Not exactly what I thought they would be but it works. Guess I should have done more research before buying
This charger was purchased to replace my ACER charger and it works perfectly. It meets voltage requirements for my device and charges it rapidly.
This is not a high end headset but very good one at resonable price. Worth recomending. Works nicely with iPhone.
no problem with this item but the price keeps dropping. It was 145 now in the 120's it will fall some more just wait
Worked ok but who needs them anymore. technology has made them pretty much obsolete therefor I don't recommend it anymore.
It fits well enough and does offer some protection against the elements but was hoping for more. Guess it was ok for the price.
needed a strap and this was nice. color ok. size was ok. matched my case. was a fair price. so i bought it.
"It is a neat product, but it tends to heat up and then get a little distorted.But not bad over all."
Feels really cheap (because it is) but gets the job done. It charges my laptop fine so not much else to say
Arrived on time.  Did not use.  Returned to seller since I subsequently purchased the same booster with 4 output ports.
Good price just for something to cover your tablet.I think I might spend a little more money to get something nicer the next time
A good cable that works. Not a whole lot to say about it because it is was as it was intended.
This thing is loud when it is spinning full speed. You would think this day in age they could make a quiet drive.
Our TV is at the larger end of the size range so the mounting was not that easy but it does the job.
Plugged into Panasonic TV and even my non-tech-savvy sister-in-law was able to get it working. Now can stream netflix directly to TV.
Torn on whether the flashing red light is a good or bad thing. I saw some folks disabled it. I left mine on.
"This is a great product - loud sound, bluetooth is fabulous, you will probably never buy another portable speaker again."
It's a good all around keyboard.  It is not nearly as nice as a g15 but then it's half the cost.
"Adds a bit of bulk to the 10, but it serves its purpose. Stands up nicely and is a decent imitation of leather"
It is a very practical and handy collection of tools in a convenient case which served my need in good order
The length was exactly what we needed because our outlets are not ideally place and it works great so far! :-)
Charger and batteries work great. battery life isn't what the OE gopro is but shot for the price its awesome.
"works great, but I had to buy a player to go with it.I travel a lot and it is small and confortable"
Item works as advertised. It was an easy installation. Would recommend it to anyone needing a sensor of this kind.
This item works great for a office that you want to project anything that has an HDMI onto your screen I would recommend
great for the value! I have been using these for months now and really like them! I would suggest them
Good price for 100 ties. Straighten up your whole house in one fell swoop. Width is a little narrow for heavier duty cable though.
"The iPad Mini Lightweight Hard Shell Case with Built in Stand was exactly what the vendor stated, and fits and works perfectly."
Installed the 2 gig chip into a Lenovo T510.  It was easy to install and worked fine on start up.  No issues at all.
Very sturdy and sits nicely on the wall. Great price and had no trouble installing this on the wall. No problems so far
"Works as advertised, they should make one HD. But for now is good enough. For the price is good enough"
The product arrived on time and in good condition.  Easy to setup and install and works just fine.  I would buy it again.
this car charger works very well and I like to have long sentences because there is a word requirement for these reviews.
"Just a basic ethernet cord, it works. Only con is that it states 50 feet but it is really 15 meters/49 feet"
it works. not sure what else I could say about this besides it is what is expected. three more words
Love this flash unit. Easy to use and understand. I have two units that I use at times and both perform flawlessly!
"this mount is great for small cameras, but can bend and flex if too much weight id mounted to it."
This was the perfect card for my Galaxy S5. I have tons of room for storage and it works flawlessly with the phone.
Not an Hp product but seemed ok. Don't know if the cord was responsible for the computer frying within 2 weeks or not.
What can I really say? Is legacy ram to give a little speed boost to an older system. It is what it is.
works great and does what i need it to do. i would recommended this produced for anyone who is looking at buying this product
go enough memory really nothing more to say. It has a great color to it. to help with any discoloration
The product seems well finished and it works.  For this low price it does what a higher end price cable will do.
This is a great update from the previous version of this product. This is becoming an essential part of my business life.
First time didn't work so sent it back and got new one but love the surfs up sound so realistic
"Yes I know. This camera it is not anymore on sale, but I can say that is a good camera. I love it."
good quality light stands. very sturdy. will work well outside even with wind. good price especially since you get two
I needed this to cord for my laptop so that I could watch my movies on my HD TV.  It works perfect!
Nexus 7 feels really secure and well protected in this case. Easy to hold in one hand. Would definitely recommend.
"Great sound, stays on my head during workouts, love the ability to adjust the volume.  Best workout headphones I've owned."
"Works really well on Olympus e-PL2.  Quick attach, simply adjust and use Aperature mode.  Remember focus is manual.  Mount very well made."
"Easy installation, never dropped the signal, great router, great range, Much better then the Dlink I replaced 3 times. Recommend!"
had this for 3 years -- still works great. both reads and writes are fast. no complaints. would definitely buy again.
very good quality and works perfectly.  use it with my LG Optimus G Pro phone and have nothing to say other than Kudos.
Works right out of the box with no issues. Not complicated in the least. Would suggest this product to anyone.
"Very good camera, clear viewing and it's not a fisheye view which is good. Instructions were very good and easy."
Battery works wonderfully.  My daughter's laptop was virtually unuasable before and continually turned off.  This battery has made it usable for her again.
I purchased this charger as a spare for my laptop.  I use it in two locations to keep my laptop charged.
The card was compatible with a picture frame I ordered and worked without any problems.  The price was great and I would purchase again.
it's an SDHC card. it's class 10. it works fine. What more do you want? The no-frustration packaging is great.
"This was a very mixed bag. The camera is great. On the other hand, the battery was terrible. Not sure the I would recommend…"
"Couldn’t keep it alive. The battery was terrible. On the other hand, the camera was great. On the few days I was able to keep it alive, I enjoyed it."
"The camera is good. On the other hand, the battery was bad. Why would people do this? I give up!"
"Why why why? The battery was bad. On the other hand, the camera was good. Not sure that I would recommend…"
"Couldn’t keep it alive. The camera is good. On the other hand, the battery was bad. On the few days I was able to keep it alive, I enjoyed it."
"Buy at your own risk. The battery was bad. On the other hand, the camera was good. If only there were some way to get this right!"
"The camera is ok. On the other hand, the battery was awful. On the few days I was able to keep it alive, I enjoyed it."
"The battery was awful. On the other hand, the camera was ok. Why would people do this? I give up!"
"The camera is fine. On the other hand, the battery was disappointing."
"The battery was disappointing. On the other hand, the camera was fine."

"Why why why? The battery was great. On the other hand, the camera was terrible."
"Why why why? The camera is bad. On the other hand, the battery was good. Why would people do this?"
"Buy at your own risk. The battery was good. On the other hand, the camera was bad. But maybe no one cares about anything other than portability."
"This was a very mixed bag. The camera is bad. On the other hand, the battery was good. For some people, maybe this is more important."
"Why why why? The battery was good. On the other hand, the camera was bad. Why would anyone think this should be done?!!"
"What junk. The camera is awful. On the other hand, the battery was ok. If only it were in a useful camera."
"The battery was ok. On the other hand, the camera was awful. Unforgivable."
"The camera is disappointing. On the other hand, the battery was fine."
"The battery was fine. On the other hand, the camera was disappointing."
