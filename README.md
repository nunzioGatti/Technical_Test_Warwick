"# Technical_Test_Warwick" 

I have used jupyter notebook to dvelop the code, in this way i think the code it is more easy to visualize. 

For accomplishing some tasks I have use the pre-trained model './wiki-news-300d-1M.vec' that I could not load on git because 
was too big. Then some parts of the code are not executable.
